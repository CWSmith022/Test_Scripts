What we would expect is that the model would try to predict it based on its data to the most similar class instead of identifying it as something new. <u> This is where anomaly detection comes in. What anomaly detection does is take a set of known data that we can call, values that we know exist and are true. </u> Then we can introduce a test set full of data values that it does not know, if the data looks very dismilar to the trained and known data then the model will call it an anomaly. Knowing this, we can create a 2-step machine learning approach whereby we train and anomaly detection system on known data that can then be subsetted into a mutliclassification task. Thereby, future occurences then will filter out unknown data measurements that are new to the system and not similar to the known and still allow us to predict on known cases. See below for an example of this using fruit data collected in the lab.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":72,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import Libraries for modeling\n","\n","# For Data processing and import\n","import numpy as np \n","import pandas as pd\n","from secret_settings import *\n","from datetime import datetime\n","import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n","\n","# Machine Learning\n","from sklearn.svm import OneClassSVM, SVC\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix\n","from sklearn.metrics import ConfusionMatrixDisplay\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, LabelEncoder\n","from sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n","\n","# For plotting\n","from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n","from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\n","import seaborn as sns \n","sns.set_style('ticks')\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["\n"," In this dataset are five classes of fruits, oranges, mandarins, tangerines, lemons, and limes.

The first steps done were loading the data and filtering out orange measurements prior to 2022. The reason is that the orange data extremely varies possibly due to a change in season or even supplier.

What this means is, we are considering OMT measurments as non-anomolous that we want to further classify and then we are considering lemons and limes anomolous which are samples that are foreign to our modeling. Therefore, we want our model to discriminate OMT from lemons and limes which should not be further classified later. The first step here will be to separate out the data to train the model. To train the model we will take a subset of orange, mandarin and tangerine samples (df_omt).
