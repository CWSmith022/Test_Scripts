# Test_Scripts

### Function
The purpose of this script is to pilot an idea of creating a two step algorithm to separate familiar types of patterns from signals from non-familiar types of signals 
using an anomaly detection approach. Then if a pattern looks familiar to an algorithm it i passed to a multiclassification algorithm in order to subset and classify 
different individual signals. Alternatively, if the anomaly detection algorithm does not see familiar patterns, it will flag those ones which would require further 
investigation. Look at the .ipynb for more information.
